            <h3>1. Talk Openly About Internet Safety</h3>
            <p>Open communication is key to ensuring kids are aware of online dangers. Regularly talk to them about
                topics like cyberbullying, identity theft, and scams. Make sure they know it’s okay to come to you with
                any concerns or experiences they encounter online. Reinforce that if they ever feel uncomfortable or
                unsure, they should ask for help.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>2. Set Screen Time & Boundaries</h3>
            <p>Too much screen time can impact a child’s physical and mental health. Set clear boundaries on how much
                time they can spend on devices each day, and ensure that this includes breaks for physical activity.
                Encourage a balance by incorporating time for schoolwork, hobbies, and family interaction. Setting these
                boundaries helps kids develop healthy habits early.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>3. Use Kid-Friendly Apps & Sites</h3>
            <p>Help kids discover educational and safe online resources. Use apps and websites that are specifically
                designed for their age, with built-in privacy and security features. Encourage creativity, learning, and
                exploration, but make sure the platforms have a good track record for keeping children safe from
                inappropriate content.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>4. Teach Strong Password Habits</h3>
            <p>One of the most essential cybersecurity habits is creating strong passwords. Teach kids how to use
                passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols. Encourage them
                not to share their passwords with anyone except you. You can make it fun by turning it into a game to
                create new, unique passwords for different apps and websites!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>5. Stay Involved & Curious</h3>
            <p>Show interest in your child’s online activities. Ask them about the games they play, the videos they
                watch, and who they interact with online. By staying involved, you’ll be able to detect any potential
                issues early on. Don’t be afraid to ask questions about online interactions, and engage in their digital
                world as much as possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>6. Enable Parental Controls</h3>
            <p>Parental controls can be a powerful tool for monitoring your child’s online activity. Use built-in
                controls on devices and apps to filter content, restrict access to certain websites, and set time
                limits. This ensures that children only access age-appropriate content while allowing you to maintain a
                sense of control over their digital experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>7. Spot & Report Phishing</h3>
            <p>Phishing scams are one of the most common ways hackers trick people into revealing sensitive information.
                Teach your child to recognize suspicious emails, messages, or pop-ups that ask for personal information.
                Show them how to spot signs of phishing, such as mismatched URLs or offers that seem “too good to be
                true.” Encourage them to always report suspicious activity to you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>8. Create a Cyber-Safe Environment</h3>
            <p>Establish clear rules for safe online behavior and make sure these rules are posted somewhere visible in
                the house. Use simple and memorable phrases like “Think Before You Click” or “Don’t Share Personal Info
                Online.” This visual reminder helps keep the concept of cyber safety in their minds and encourages them
                to make responsible decisions while online.</p>
